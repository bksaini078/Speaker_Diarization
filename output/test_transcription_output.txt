Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'd love to start with these.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: Ten years of work right there.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Someone on your team called these the real life Tony Stark glasses.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: very hard to make each one.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: That makes me feel incredibly optimistic.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: In a world where AI gets smarter and smarter, this is probably going to be the next major platform after phones.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: I miss hugging my mom.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: The haptics is hard.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: How does generative AI change how social media feels? We haven't found the end yet. The average American has fewer friends now than they did 15 years ago. Why do you think that's happening?
Speaker SPEAKER_00: We haven't found the end yet.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: I mean, there's a lot going on to unpack there.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'm about to interview Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
Speaker SPEAKER_02: 
Speaker SPEAKER_00: Zuckerberg
Speaker SPEAKER_01: There are not that many people with more power over what our future might look like. Nearly half the total human population now uses Meta products. And I just tested some of their new tech that feels like science fiction.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: This is crazy. Mark Zuckerberg and the team at META are imagining a future that billions of other people might actually end up living in. So my goal for this conversation is to try to figure out what that future really looks like. To paint a picture of the future Mark Zuckerberg is trying to build so that you can decide for yourself what you think of it. Welcome to the first episode of our new series, Huge Conversations.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: Okay, good to meet you. Yeah, looking forward to it.
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Awesome.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: I'd love to tell you what my goal is of this conversation. Go for it. So we have a show called Hugh Jiftrue, which is this very optimistic show about science and technology and the potential futures that we can build. And in every episode we're sort of exploring what does it look like if you play a certain technological future out. And so my goal in this conversation is to...
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Go for it.
Speaker SPEAKER_02: She has been so popular for over an hour at Thven phonnemes those people love to see
Speaker SPEAKER_01: try to help people see the future that you're imagining when you're building the products that you and the meta team are building. What are you imagining this looks like in the future? How are you imagining people use this? All of that. Cool. Awesome. So I'd love to start with these.
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Awesome.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: Let's do it. 10 years of work right there.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: I got to demo them a little bit earlier today.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: I heard someone on your team call these the real-life Tony Stark glasses.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: We're getting there.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: But I'd love to just hear in your voice. What are these?
Speaker SPEAKER_00: Well, these are the first full holographic augmented reality glasses, I think that exist in the world. We've made...
Speaker SPEAKER_00: I think it's a few thousand or something. Very hard to make each one of these. But this is the culmination of 10 years of research and development that we've done to basically miniaturize all the computing that you need to have glasses, not a headset, but glasses that can put full holograms into the world with a wide field of view. So you can imagine in the future we'd be having a version of this conversation where maybe I or you are not even here. It's like one of us is physically here and the other one is here as a full body hologram. And it's not just a video call. You can actually interact. You can do things. I mean, in the demo we had the ping pong and games and things like that. But you can interact. You can work together. You can play poker, play chess, whatever. Holographic cards, holographic board game. I just think it's going to be wild. It's going to remake so many different.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: fields that we think about today from how we work and productivity to a lot of things around science, a lot of things around education, entertainment, fun, gaming. But this is just the beginning. This is the first version. It's a prototype version that we've made in order to develop the next version, which is hopefully going to be the consumer one that we sell to a lot of people.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Why build this?
Speaker SPEAKER_00: Well, I think it's going to be the next major computing platform. So if you look at the grand arc of computing over time, you've gone from mainframes to computers that basically live on your desk or on a tower, to phones that you have in your hand that you basically can take with you everywhere that you want, but it's pretty unnatural. It takes you away from the world around you. I think that the trend in computing is it gets more ubiquitous, it gets more natural, and it just gets more social. So you want to be able to interact with people in the world around you, and I think that this is probably going to be the next major platform after phones.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: Look at these two. These are the clear ones that show all the technology.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: 我覺得
Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the whole thing is a special edition and this is like a really special edition. There's not a single millimeter.
Speaker SPEAKER_00: of space. It's everything in here from the micro projectors that basically shoot light into the waveguides. It's a special type of display system. These aren't normal displays. You have a phone or a TV or computer, the type of displays that people have been building for decades. It's a waveguide system. The projector that's shooting light basically goes into these nano-etchings across the waveguide that are what catches and creates the holograms in order to synchronize that with where you're looking. There's eye tracking and little cameras. They illuminate your eyes. And then of course there's all the basic stuff that you need, all the computing, the batteries to power the whole thing, microphones, the speakers because it needs to be able to play audio and speak with you. And the cameras and sensors to see things around you in the world. That way when it's placing holograms in the world, it can do that in the right place and understand where you are. That probably is still not covering everything because there's a lot of things that need to go into syncing up the holographic images between the two displays because you don't just have a single display like you have in a phone or TV. You have two and it moves around and physical things are hard and need to be synced up. There's also the radio that has to communicate with your other computing devices to do heavier computing and the wrist-based neural interface that you probably got to try out. We kind of miniaturized all of this and fit it into a normal looking pair of glasses which is...
Speaker SPEAKER_00: When I told the team that we were going to do this 10 years ago, people weren't sure if we were going to be able to. But I think not only were we going to be able to do this, but I think we were going to be able to get a cheaper and higher quality and even smaller and more stylish over time. So I think this is going to be a pretty wild future.
Speaker SPEAKER_01: There are so many versions of trying to get a similar idea of digital objects in physical space. I'm thinking of, for example...
Speaker SPEAKER_01: glasses that have heads up displays where it's headlocked and it's moving with my eyes, glasses that are really creating digital objects in physical space that don't move as I move. I'm thinking of these, I'm also thinking of the Snapchat spectacles that they just announced. Then on the other hand, there are headsets like the Quest and also like the Apple Vision Pro that seem to fall into a different category. I'm curious how you would organize this landscape for people and how you think about people using these tools in their real lives in the near future.
Speaker SPEAKER_02: where
Speaker SPEAKER_02: Bye bye.
Speaker SPEAKER_02: As I move?
